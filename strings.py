# in this file I'll be practicing strings and a few basic ways to use or
# manipulate strings.

# string variable for our name
name = 'Jason'

# string variable for a number as a string
stringNum = "1"

# printing a string, in this case the word Hello with
print ("Hello")

# printing string variable name
print (name)

# printing the same string and concatenating (fancy word for appending) the
# variable name to it
print ("Hello" + name)

# notice the previous line printed "Hello" and name with no space between them
# let's fix that by simply adding an extra space after "Hello" so "Hello "
print ("Hello " + name)

# printing a number as a string
print (stringNum)
