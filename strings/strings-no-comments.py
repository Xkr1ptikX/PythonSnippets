# string variables
name = 'Jason'
stringNum = "1"

print ("Hello")
print (name + "\n")
print ('Hello' + name)
print ("Hello" + " " + name)

# empty print statement
print()

print ("num: " + stringNum)
print ("first num: " + stringNum + "; second num: " + str(2))

# string variable
greet = 'Hello '

print()

print (greet + name + ' your number is: ' + stringNum)
